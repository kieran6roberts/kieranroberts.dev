        I love building fast, accessible and slick websites for the modern web.
        With almost 3 years worth of industry experience and expertise in many
        modern web technologies, I'm always striving to build!

        Four years ago I started my journey into software engineering when I
        decided to change career paths. As a university graduate with a Masters
        in Electronic Engineering, I decided it wasn't for me and spent more
        than a year teaching myself to code.

        Fast forward to today and I absolutely love what I do. If you want to
        get in touch with me you can find me at one of the many links, or reach
        out using the <a href="/contact" class="text-l-secondary">
          contact form here</a
