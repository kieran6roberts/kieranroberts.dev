      <p>Born in Wales, UK üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø, I'm now currently based in Ireland üáÆüá™.</p>
      <p>
        Four years ago I started my journey into software engineering when I
        decided to change career paths. As a university graduate with a Masters
        degree in Electronic Engineering, I decided it was no longer my passion
        and spent more than a year teaching myself to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to today and I absolutely love what I do. Outside of
        software development I love to go hiking and travelling when possible,
        and a big sports as well. I'm currently teaching myself to play guitar
        and love to cook and try new foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, if you want to get in touch with me you can find me at one of
        the many social links I've shared.
      </p>
